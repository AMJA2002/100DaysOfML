# Streamlit Python Tutorial: Build Machine Learning Model

A Machine Learning model is undone if it just remains in Jupyter Notebook. `Streamlit` provides a faster way to build and share data web apps. It turns `Jupyter Notebook Python Scripts` into a great-looking `Web App`. And still, it just takes a few minutes. The only pre-requisites to build machine learning model using Streamlit is `Python Programming`. And we got you covered.

Check the detailed [Anime Vyuh Python Tutorials Series](https://animevyuh.org/category/python-tutorials), Python made easy.

### Why Streamlit?

`Streamlit` makes the frontend looks simple. It is compatible with basically everything, that includes `Tensorflow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch`, `OpenCV`, and so on. Building Machine Learning models is a great way to analyze and visualize your Python scripts and later it is even shareable. Streamlit even helps to deploy your web app with very simple steps to follow. We shall see that in the next article.

### Streamlit vs Flask vs Django

`Flask` and `Django` are widely used Python Web Development Frameworks. Even though these two are easy to program, Streamlit is even much easier. Streamlit doesnâ€™t require `HTML`, `CSS` code snippets, define routes, and handle HTTP requests. It has got everything covered for you. You just need to use the in-built widget to build an end-end Web Application.

### Streamlitâ€™s open-source app framework is a cakewalk to get started with:

```py
pip install streamlit
```

> **Warning**
> Before proceeding with the working of the Streamlit web app, it is recommended to create a Virtual  Environment. You can check this article onðŸ‘‰ [How to create a Virtual Environment for Python programs?](https://animevyuh.org/deploy-a-flask-app-on-heroku/)
 

### Streamlit Widgets
Widgets make our tasks easier to build machine learning using Streamlit. Streamlit provides a wide range  of widgets and using this widget is just easier as naming variables. I mean it when I say it is super easy. You can build Streamlit Web App in a few minutes.

Lets look into Streamlit Widgets inside the .py file...
